Notes
These variables make most sense for aircraft with flight plans. If an aircraft does not have a flight plan, the value returned will be 0 (or false), or an empty string, depending on the units. 
These variables only make sense for aircraft generated by the traffic database, and so have schedules. If an aircraft does not have a schedule, the value returned will be 0 (or false), or an empty string, depending on the units.

In the multiplayer Shared Cockpit mode the only supported index is 1, which means that the data is assumed to be identical for all engines. In single player mode engine indexes are from 1 to 4.
